- **University-Specific Boards:** Items are segregated by university for easy searching.
- **Post Lost or Found Items:** Users can create detailed posts with descriptions, locations, and images.
- **Real-time Status Updates:** Mark items as "Reunited" once they have been returned.
- **Secure Messaging:** Directly and safely contact the owner or finder without sharing personal information.
- **Smart Search & Filtering:** Quickly find items by category, date, or location.
- **User Authentication:** Secure registration and login for a personalized experience.
